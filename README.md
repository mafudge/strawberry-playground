# Strawberry Playground


## demo

- simple demo of graphql with strawberry backed by a json data with a code schema


## dynamicdemo

- auto-generate the schema from the json file. probably not a good idea


## outofbanddemo

- execute `schema_gen.py` ==> creates `models.py` from `books.json`

# server

in all three examples....

`$ python -m strawberry server schema.py`
